# Ingress

There are two parts to Ingress:

- the controller, which is a reverse proxy that receives all incoming traffic
- the Ingress objects which set up the routing rules for the controller.

You can choose from different controllers. We'll use the [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/), but [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/providers/kubernetes-ingress/) and [Contour - a CNCF project](https://projectcontour.io) are popular alternatives.

## API specs

- [Ingress (networking.k8s.io/v1)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.20/#ingress-v1-networking-k8s-io)

<details>
  <summary>YAML overview</summary>

Ingress rules can have multiple mappings, but they're pretty straightforward. 

You usually have one object per app, and they are namespaced, so you can deploy them in the same namespace as the app:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: whoami
spec:
  rules:
  - host: whoami.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: whoami-internal
            port: 
              name: http
```

- `rules` - collection of routing rules
- `host` - the DNS host name of the web app
- `http` - ingress routing is only for web traffic
- `paths` - collection of request paths, mapping to Kubernetes Services
- `path` - the HTTP request path, can be generic `/` or specific `/admin`
- `pathType` - whether path matching is as a `Prefix` or `Exact`
- `backend.service` - Service where the controller will fetch content

## Deploy an Ingress controller

It's not a good name, because an ingress controller isn't a specific type of Kubernetes object - like a Deployment is a Pod controller. 

An ingress controller is a logical thing, composed of a Service, a Pod controller and a set of RBAC rules:

- [01_namespace.yaml](specs/ingress-controller/01_namespace.yaml) - ingress controllers are shared for all apps, so they usuall have their own namespace
- [02_rbac.yaml](specs/ingress-controller/02_rbac.yaml) - RBAC rules so the ingress controller can query the Kubernetes API for Service endpoints, Ingress objects and more
- [configmap.yaml](specs/ingress-controller/configmap.yaml) - additional config for Nginx, to enable proxy caching
- [daemonset.yaml](specs/ingress-controller/daemonset.yaml) - DaemonSet to run the ingress controller Pods; contains a few fields you haven't seen yet
- [services.yaml](specs/ingress-controller/services.yaml) - Services for external access

Deploy the controller:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/ingress-controller

kubectl get all -n ingress-nginx

kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx
```

> Browse to localhost:8000 / localhost:30000. There are no apps running in the cluster but you'll get a 404 response, which comes from the ingress controller

The ingress controller is powered by Nginx, but you don't need to configure routing inside Nginx - you treat it as a black box and do all the configuration with Ingress objects.

## Publish a default app through ingress

We'll start with a default app which will be a catch-all, so users won't ever see the 404 response from the ingress controller.

- [default/deployment.yaml](specs/default/deployment.yaml) - a simple Nginx deployment, using the standard Nginx image not the ingress controller
- [default/configmap.yaml](specs/default/configmap.yaml) - configuration containing HTML file for Nginx to show
- [default/service.yaml](specs/default/service.yaml) - ClusterIP Service

Deploy the default web app:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/default
```

Nothing happens yet. Services aren't automatically wired up to the ingress controller - you do that by specifying routing rules in an Ingress object:

- [ingress/default.yaml](specs/default/ingress/default.yaml) - Ingress rule with no host specified, so all requests will go here by default

Now deploy the ingress rule:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/default/ingress

kubectl get ingress
```

When you browse to any URL you'll see the default response:

> Browse to localhost:8000/a/bc.php / localhost:30000/a/bc.php

<details>
  <summary>â„¹ Ingress controllers usually have their own default backend.</summary>
 
 That's where the 404 response originally came from Nginx. An alternative to running your own default app is to [customize the default backend](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/default-backend/).

</details><br/>

## Publish an app to a specific host address

To publish all of your apps through the ingress controller it's the same pattern - have an internal Service over the application Pods, and an Ingress object with routing rules.

Here's the spec for the whoami app, which will publish to a specific host name:

- [whoami.yaml](specs/whoami/whoami.yaml) - Deployment and ClusterIP Service for the app, nothing ingress-specific
- [whoami/ingress.yaml](specs/whoami/ingress.yaml) - Ingress which routes traffic with the host domain `whoami.local` to the ClusterIP Service

ðŸ“‹ Deploy the app and check the Ingress rules.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/whoami

kubectl get ingress
```

</details><br/>

To access the site locally you'll need to add an entry in your [hosts file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_(file)) - this script will do it for you (replace the IP address with a node IP if you're using a remote cluster):

```
# using Powershell - your terminal needs to be running as Admin:
./scripts/add-to-hosts.ps1 whoami.local 127.0.0.1

# on macOS or Linux - you'll be asked for your sudo password:
sudo chmod +x ./scripts/add-to-hosts.sh
./scripts/add-to-hosts.sh whoami.local 127.0.0.1
```

> Browse to whoami.local:8000 / whoami.local:30000 and you'll see the site. There are multiple replicas - refresh to see load-balancing between them

## Use ingress with response caching

The Ingress API doesn't support all the features of every ingress controller, so to use custom features you set the configuration in annotations.

We'll publish the Pi web app on the hostname `pi.local`, first using a simple Ingress with no response cache:

- [pi.yaml](specs/pi/pi.yaml) - Deployment and Service for the app
- [pi/ingress.yaml](specs/pi/ingress.yaml) - Ingress which routes `pi.local` to the Service

ðŸ“‹ Deploy the app, check the status and add `pi.local` to your hosts file.

<details>
  <summary>Not sure how?</summary>

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/pi

kubectl get ingress

kubectl get po -l app=pi-web

# Windows:
./scripts/add-to-hosts.ps1 pi.local 127.0.0.1

# *nix:
./scripts/add-to-hosts.sh pi.local 127.0.0.1
```


</details><br/>

> Browse to http://pi.local:8000/pi?dp=25000 / http://pi.local:30000/pi?dp=25000; it'll take a second or so to see the response. Refresh and you'll see the request is load-balanced and the response is calculated every time.

We can update the Ingress object to use response caching - which the Nginx ingress controller supports:

- [ingress-with-cache.yaml](specs/pi/update/ingress-with-cache.yaml) - uses Nginx annotations to use the cache; the controller looks for this when it sets up the config for the site

There's no change to the app, only the Ingress:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/pi/update
```

> Now browse to http://pi.local:8000/pi?dp=25000 / http://pi.local:30000/pi?dp=25000 - you'll see the cached response with every refresh.


<details>
  <summary>â„¹ Typically you won't want to cache all parts of your app.</summary>

You may have different Ingress rules - one for all static content which has the cache annotation, and another for dynamic content.

## Lab

Two parts to this lab. First we want to take the configurable web app and publish it through the ingress controller. 

The app spec is already in place to get you started:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/configurable
```

The second part is we'd like to change the ingress controller to use the standard ports - 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. You'll only be able to do that if you're using the LoadBalancer.

## **EXTRA** Create a TLS cert for HTTPS access

<details>
  <summary>Using ingress for SSL termination</summary>

Ingress controllers are the single entrypoint for all your apps. They're great for centralizing concerns like caching and HTTPS. 

The controller applies the TLS certificates to the public endpoint, and internally the apps work on plain HTTP.

The Ingress spec supports HTTPS and the Nginx ingress controller is already running with a TLS certificate:

> Browse to https://whoami.local:8040 or https://whoami.local:30040

You'll see an error because this is a self-signed certificate, which means it's not trusted. You can check the cert details in your browser and you'll see something like this:

![](/img/ingress-controller-cert.png)

You can apply your own certificates in Ingress rules. You might buy a TLS cert from an online provider specific to your host domains, but we'll generate our own:

- [cert-generator.yaml](specs/tls/cert-generator.yaml) - uses a tool to create a TLS cert for our domains

Generate the certs:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/tls

kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod tls-cert-generator

kubectl logs tls-cert-generator
```

(The Pod runs some OpenSSH commands - here's the
[script](https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol/blob/master/ch15/docker-images/cert-generator/start.sh) if you want to see how it's done).

Now you can copy the cert files from the Pod to your local machine:

```
kubectl cp tls-cert-generator:/certs/server-cert.pem tls.crt

kubectl cp tls-cert-generator:/certs/server-key.pem tls.key
```

And use them to create a Secret. Kubernetes supports TLS certificates as a special Secret type, and you pass the certificate file and key to the `create secret` command:

```
kubectl create secret tls https-local --key=tls.key --cert=tls.crt

kubectl label secret https-local k8sfun.courselabs.co=ingress

kubectl describe secret https-local
```

Now we have a Secret with a TLS cert that can be used for our local app domains.

<details>
  <summary>â„¹ Creating a TLS Secret is what you do if you have a manual process to get your certificates. </summary>

Ideally you should use an automated process instead so your certs never expire - [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io) is how you do that in Kubernetes.

</details><br />

## **EXTRA** Expose apps through HTTPS

<details>
  <summary>HTTP to HTTPS redirection with ingress</summary>

HTTPS is really easy to apply with ingress - you just add the name of the Secret containing the TLS certificate to the Ingress spec:

- [pi-https.yaml](specs/tls/ingress/pi-https.yaml) - uses the TLS Secret for the Pi app; the folder contains the same updates for the other Ingress objects

Add TLS support:

```
kubectl apply -f labs/ingress/specs/tls/ingress

kubectl get ingress
```

> The basic Ingress view doesn't show the TLS setup, you need to `describe` to see that

Now you can browse to the sites at the HTTPS endpoint:

- https://pi.local:8040
- https://whoami.local:8040

> You'll still get a browser warning, but if this was a trusted cert from a real authority you wouldn't

Ingress also redirects HTTP requests to HTTP **but it only uses the default port 443**:

```
curl -v http://pi.local:8040/
```

> We're using a non-standard port for HTTPS, so the redirect won't work. In a real cluster the Service for the Ingress controller would listen on ports 80 and 443.
